  <h3 class="text-center"><em>Timeline of Einstien's life:</em></h3>
 
 
    <ul style="border: 10px solid silver"
      <li><strong> March 14 1879- Albert Einstien was born in Ulm, in the  Kingdom of Württemberg.</strong></li>
      <li><strong> 1880- Famiy moves to munich, where his father and uncle jacob founded Elektrotechnische Fabrik J. Einstein & Cie. A company that manufactured electrical equipment based on direct current.</strong></li>
      <li><strong>1905-
  The Annus Mirabilis papers are four articles pertaining to the photoelectric effect (which gave rise to quantum theory), Brownian motion, the special theory of relativity, and E = mc2 that Einstein published in the Annalen der Physik scientific journal.</strong></li>
     <li><strong> 1907- Einstein proposed a model of matter where each atom in a lattice structure is an independent harmonic
     oscillator. In the Einstein model, each atom oscillates independently—a series of equally spaced quantized states for each oscillator. Einstein was aware that getting the frequency of the actual oscillations would be difficult, but he nevertheless proposed this theory because it was a particularly clear demonstration that quantum mechanics could solve the specific heat problem in classical mechanics</strong></li>
<li><strong> 1921–1922- washington, new york, london, asia, palistine, sygapore, ceylon and japan were among all the places visited by einstein where he was being honored and/or delivering speeches.</strong></li>
     
      <li><strong> 1940- Became a us citizen</strong></li>
      <li><strong> 1955-Einstein experienced internal bleeding caused by the rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm, which had previously been reinforced surgically by Rudolph Nissen in 1948.[127] He took the draft of a speech he was preparing for a television appearance commemorating the State of Israel's seventh anniversary with him to the hospital, but he did not live long enough to complete it.</strong></li>
      
      <p>“A human being is a part of the whole called by us universe, a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and feeling as something separated from the rest, a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty.” </p>
